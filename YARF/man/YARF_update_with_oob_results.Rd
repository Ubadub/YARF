  oob_cost_calculation_script = NULL,
  indices = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{yarf_mod}{The yarf model object}

\item{oob_cost_calculation_script}{An optional custom Javascript function which calculates the cost of a prediction given the true
                                            value of the prediction (see below). If is likely similar to \code{cost_single_node_calc_script}. It
                                            is recommended to share code between them by writing a function included in \code{shared_scripts} which is
                                            passed into \code{YARF} upon construction and can be referenced when calculating OOB results.

                                              function oobCost(y_hat, y)\{ //y_hat is the predicted value and y is the true value (both are of type double)

                                                ...

                                                return double //where a larger number indicates a higher cost to the error between y and y_hat.

                                              \}}

\item{indices}{The indices to compute OOB performance. This is generally a private argument
for use by the validation / test functions.}
